- Optimize Shipping Logistics: Efforts to reduce shipping times in Australia & Oceania and Asia could improve customer satisfaction and sales volumes in those regions.
- Profit Maximization Strategy: Focusing on high-profit regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe, while optimizing costs in low-profit regions, could improve overall profitability.
